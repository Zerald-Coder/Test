Bar graph : Typically used to represent quantitative or qualitative data. It gives a visual overview of
differences in frequency (or percentage) between categories.

Pie chart : Typically used to represent qualitative data. It gives a visual
overview of proportions belonging to each category.

Histogram : A histogram displays frequencies of quantitative data that have been sorted into intervals.
These give visual overview of the shape of distribution of the data values. Specifically,
skewness is a measure of symmetry of the data distribution, or rather, asymmetry.

Box plot : Also known as box and whiskers plot, is another way to display quantitative data.
It is especially effective for comparing multiple groups of data sets.

Symmetrical : mode = median = mean : Mirror image about the centre

Positively skewed : mode < median < mean : Tail extends to right

Negatively skewed : mode > median > mean : Tail extends to left

Minimum data < Q1 < median < Q3 < Maximum data

Range = Maximum data - Minimum data

Interquartile Range = Q3 - Q1

Lower fence = Q1 - (1.5 * IQR)

Upper fence = Q3 + (1.5 * IQR)

Application for mode : Most useful in, but not limited to, qualitative data.

Application for median : Good for quantitative data that has outliers and/or is skewed.

Application for mean : Good for quantitative data that are quite symmetrical and has no outlier.

Application for interquartile range & range : Range is a quick and easy measure but sensitive to outliers; whereas IQR is not sensitive to outliers. Both are good for skewed data.

Corresponding measure of centre: median

Application for standard deviation & variance : Good for data that are quite symmetrical. SD is more commonly used than its squared counterpart, variance.

Corresponding measure of centre: mean

Small standard deviation : Data values are tightly bunched together

Large standard deviation : Data values are spread apart

Variance = Standard deviation^2

Standard deviation for population is represented by lowercase greek letter sigma

Standard deviation for sample is represented by letter s

Explanatory variable : x-axis of scatter plot

Response variable : y-axis of scatter plot

Perfect correlation : |r| = 1.0

Strong correlation : 0.8 < |r| < 1.0

Moderate correlation : 0.5 < |r| < 0.8

Weak correlation : 0.0 < |r| < 0.5

No correlation :  r = 0.0

Classical probability is used when each outcome in a sample space is equally likely to occur.

Empirical probability is based on observations obtained from probability experiments.

Probability lesser than 0.05 is rare event

If events A and B are disjoint : P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)

If events A and B are independent : P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)

X ~ B(n,p) where n = number of trial and p = probability of success

P(X = x) = (nCx)(p^x)(1-p)^(n-x) where x is the exact number of success

Expected number of success (represented by lowercase greek letter mu) = n * p

X ~ N(mean,variance) where mean is represented by lowercase greek letter mu

Z ~ N(0,1) where mean and variance is converted to 0 and 1 respectively

68-95-99.7 rule

z-score = (x - mean)/(standard deviation)

Simple random sampling : A sample is selected in such a way that every item or person in the population has the same chance of being selected.

Systematic sampling : A random starting point is selected and then every kth member of the population is selected.

Cluster sampling : A population is divided into clusters or groups. Then clusters are randomly selected and a sample is collected by randomly selecting from each cluster.

Stratified sampling : A population is divided into subgroups and a sample is selected from all subgroups according to the proportions of each subgroup (proportion of the population).

Distribution of sample mean is normal when population distribution is normal or the sample size is at least 30 due to central limit theorem.

When distribution of sample mean is normal : 
mean of sample mean = population mean 
standard deviation of sample mean = standard deviation of population divided by square root of sample size

Standard deviation of sample mean known as standard error

z-score for sample mean = (square root of sample size) * (sample mean - mean) / (standard deviation of population)

If standard deviation of sample is used to estimate standard deviation of population, z-score for sample mean follows student's t-distribution

Confidence interval = Point estimate +- Margin of error
Margin of error = Critical value * Standard error

Consider outlier as maximum or minimum unless stated otherwise
